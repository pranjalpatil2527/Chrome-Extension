## Features

- **Save Input**: Save links manually entered by the user in the input box.
- **Save Tab**: Save the URL of the currently active tab in the Chrome browser with just one click.
- **Delete All**: Delete all the previously saved links at once.

## Use Cases

The Chrome Extension can be useful in various scenarios, including:

1. **Bookmarking Favorite Websites**: Users can quickly save their favorite websites or webpages for easy access later by using the "Save Input" button. This eliminates the need to manually bookmark each site, providing a more streamlined experience.

2. **Research and Reference**: When conducting research or browsing the web, users can use the "Save Tab" button to instantly save the URL of the current tab. This is particularly helpful for academic or professional purposes, allowing users to quickly gather relevant sources and references.

3. **Temporary Link Storage**: The extension can serve as a temporary storage solution for links that users need to access temporarily. Rather than cluttering their bookmarks or opening numerous tabs, users can save links using the extension and delete them when they are no longer needed.

4. **Organization and Cleanup**: The "Delete All" button enables users to easily clean up their saved links, providing a way to start fresh or remove outdated links. This feature is especially useful for users who frequently save links and want to keep their collection well-organized.
